# ICECD Community Empowerment Platform

**Solution By Team-24🏆 (Winning Team for this Problem Statement)**

## Overview

This project was developed for JPMorgan Chase's **Code for Good 2025** hackathon in collaboration with **ICECD (Indian Centre for Entrepreneurship and Career Development)**.

ICECD has empowered over 10 million entrepreneurs across 55 countries over the past 38+ years. However, the organization is currently limited by its reliance on scattered WhatsApp groups for post-training communication and tracking progress. Our platform aims to solve this by providing a unified digital space for global collaboration, continuous mentorship, and success tracking.
